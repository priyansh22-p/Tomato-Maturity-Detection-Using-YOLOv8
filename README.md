# Tomato-Maturity-Detection-Using-YOLOv8
This project is to detect different maturity levels of tomatoes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Tomato Maturity Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nexuswho/laboro-tomato)


The dataset has the following categories for classification:

b_fully_ripened: Fully ripened tomatoes (better quality).
b_half_ripened: Half ripened tomatoes (better quality).
b_green: Unripe (green) tomatoes (better quality).
l_fully_ripened: Fully ripened tomatoes (low quality).
l_half_ripened: Half ripened tomatoes (low quality).
l_green: Unripe (green) tomatoes (low quality).
There are a total of 6 classes (denoted as nc: 6).
